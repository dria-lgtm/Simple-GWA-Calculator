# REFLECTION
To host my Simple GWA Calculator project, I first wrote and tested it locally to ensure it worked correctly. Then, I made a new repository on GitHub and made new project files, which also included the Python script and README. One challenge I faced was realizing that it would be hard or even impossible for GitHub Pages to run Python code, so I overcame this by providing instructions in the README for users to download and run the script locally. Another challenge was organizing the files and documenting the steps clearly for others, which I solved by writing an organized README. Cloud hosting makes my project more useful because it allows anyone to access the code instantly, view instructions, and test it out without me being there physically. Overall, using github made my project more shareable, and easy to maintain.
