# GWA-Calculator
This project is a Python-based Grade Weighted Average (GWA) calculator that allows students to calculate, save, and view their quarterly grades. Users can input the number of subjects and their corresponding grades, adnd the program computes the average for that quarter. This tool is easy to use, light, and can help students monitor their progress.
